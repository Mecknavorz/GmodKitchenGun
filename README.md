# GmodKitchenGun
Source code and files from the kitchen gun weapon I made for Garry's Mod
doesn't contain the models I used in making it since I didn't make those models and I don't want to claim ownership of them or take credit for them.

the addon itself [can be found here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2636614665&tscn=1635194788)
